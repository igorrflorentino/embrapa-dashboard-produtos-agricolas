"""Two-phase Bronze pipeline for IBGE PEVS.

Phase 1 (``extract_raw``) fetches the SIDRA response (already filtered by the
API query — table, classification, products, year window) and archives it
verbatim to the GCS raw zone. Phase 2 (``bronze_from_raw``) reads it back,
stamps ``ingestion_timestamp`` and loads BigQuery Bronze. See
``PLANS/raw_zone_architecture.md``.

SIDRA is queried fresh each run (a GET with no ETag), so Phase 1 always
re-extracts and overwrites the raw object for the configured window; the
``--from-raw`` path rebuilds Bronze from that archive without re-querying SIDRA.
