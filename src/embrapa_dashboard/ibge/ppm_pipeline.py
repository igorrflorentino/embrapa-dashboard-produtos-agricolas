"""Two-phase Bronze pipeline for IBGE PPM (Pesquisa da Pecuária Municipal, SIDRA).

PPM is the *third* IBGE/SIDRA source. Like PEVS and PAM it reuses the generic
SIDRA client (``fetch_sidra_dataframe``: per-state parallelism + recursive
period-halving) and the all-STRING Bronze schema (``ibge.pipeline._bronze_schema``),
but it diverges in one structural way: PPM is **multi-table**. Its measures live
in TWO distinct SIDRA tables with different classification axes:

* ``3939`` "Efetivo dos rebanhos" — herd HEADCOUNT (variable 105, unit *Cabeças*),
  classification 79 (*tipo de rebanho*). A STOCK, with NO monetary value.
* ``74`` "Produção de origem animal" — milk/eggs/honey/wool output (variable 106
  quantity + 215 value; the derived 1000215 *percentual* series is excluded),
  classification 80 (*tipo de produto de origem animal*). A FLOW with value.

Each table lands in its OWN Bronze table and its OWN raw-zone segment
(``raw/ibge/ppm_herd/`` vs ``raw/ibge/ppm_animal/``), so a ``--from-raw`` replay
of one never picks up the other (the same isolation PEVS/PAM use against each
other). Silver unions the two into ``silver_ibge_ppm``.

Phase 1 (``extract_raw``) fetches each SIDRA response and archives it verbatim.
Phase 2 (``bronze_from_raw``) reads it back, stamps ``ingestion_timestamp`` and
appends to that table's BigQuery Bronze. Delta-by-default (per table): a routine
run re-fetches only the recent, still-revisable window. See
``PLANS/raw_zone_architecture.md``.

This module deliberately parallels ``ibge.pam_pipeline`` rather than refactoring
it into a shared engine: the divergence is the per-table spec loop, kept thin and
local so the stable PEVS/PAM primitives stay untouched.
