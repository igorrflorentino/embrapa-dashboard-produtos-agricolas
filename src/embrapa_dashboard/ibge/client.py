    The drain deadline scales linearly with ``periods × products × variables ×

    ``variables`` is the ``v/`` selector — an explicit comma list counts its codes,
    ``'all'`` uses a moderate constant.

    ``geo_units`` is the queried geography's municipality count (the response also grows
    ~linearly with it). It scales the per-attempt DRAIN cap ONLY: for an ``n6`` per-state
    slice callers pass the worst-case ``LARGEST_STATE_MUNICIPALITY_COUNT`` so a DENSE
    state (MG, 853) gets the generous 600s drain ceiling on a slow night (IBGE-1). The
