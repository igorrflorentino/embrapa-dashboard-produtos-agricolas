"""Two-phase, chunked, resumable Bronze pipeline for UN Comtrade.

The keyed API is pre-filtered by query (our HS codes, reporter batch, flows,
years), so — like IBGE — the fetched frame *is* the Bronze content; Phase 1
archives it verbatim to the raw zone, Phase 2 stamps ingestion_timestamp and
loads BigQuery. See ``PLANS/comtrade_flows.md``.

Chunk = ``(year, reporter-batch)`` → one API call. Resumable: a SETTLED past-year
chunk whose raw already exists is skipped, but the recent window
(``comtrade_recent_refetch_years`` back from ``comtrade_end_year``) is always
re-fetched — UN Comtrade reporters file with a ~1-2y lag, so a recent year lands
incomplete and its later reporter submissions/revisions must keep flowing in. So a
daily-quota interruption just leaves the un-archived chunks for the next run — no
lost work, no duplication beyond what Silver dedupes.

A chunk's raw object is keyed by the *content* of its reporter batch (a stable
hash of the sorted reporter codes), not by a positional index — see ``_basename``.
This makes resume robust to the UN reference reordering or changing its reporter
set between runs: a basename always refers to exactly the reporters it archived.
