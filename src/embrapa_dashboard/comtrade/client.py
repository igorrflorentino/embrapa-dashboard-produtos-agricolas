"""HTTP client for the UN Comtrade keyed JSON API.

One call returns annual bilateral trade for a *batch* of reporters across all
their partners (``partnerCode`` omitted) for the configured HS codes, flows and
years — the keyed endpoint accepts comma-lists for ``reporterCode`` / ``period``
/ ``cmdCode`` / ``flowCode`` but rejects the literal ``all`` for reporter, so the
pipeline enumerates reporters (from the public Reporters reference) and batches
them to stay under the per-call record cap.

The subscription key is sent **only** in the ``Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key``
header — never in the URL or any log/error message — so it stays secret.

    so no fixed batch size is safe. When a call comes back at the cap, the largest
    divisible request dimension is split in half — reporters, then flows, then
    cmd codes — and the halves are fetched (recursively) and concatenated, so every
    real API call stays under the cap.
