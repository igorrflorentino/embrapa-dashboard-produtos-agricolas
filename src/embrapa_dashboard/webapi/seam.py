"""The single data seam between the UI and BigQuery.

This is the Python equivalent of the prototype's ``dataStore.datasetFor`` +
``applyFilters``. It does **not** issue its own SQL — it composes the verified
``serving.gateway`` readers (Pushdown Computing: parameterized queries against
the pre-aggregated marts, memoized by ``flask-caching``) into the
``BancoSnapshot`` shapes the views consume.

Golden rule (handoff): the views never change; this layer produces data in the
shape they expect. Every per-banco difference lives here, nowhere else.

M1 scope: the seam serves the PEVS-shaped generic snapshot (products, productTS,
overviewTS, ufData, quality) for the three live bancos. Trade-only adapters
(flow/partner/monthly) and the cross-source builders arrive in M2/M3.
