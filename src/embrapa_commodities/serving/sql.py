"""Parameterized BigQuery SQL builders for the serving marts.

Every builder returns ``(sql, params)`` where ``params`` is a list of
``bigquery`` query-parameter objects. The dashboard's callbacks pass user
filters straight through as ``@param`` bindings — never string-formatted into
the SQL — so a malicious filter value can't alter the query (no SQL injection).

The one value that *cannot* be a bind parameter is a column identifier (you
cannot parameterize an identifier in standard SQL). The measure a chart sums is
chosen by the UI, so it is validated against :data:`ALLOWED_VALUE_COLUMNS`
before being interpolated — an allowlist, not escaping.

Pure module: builds strings and parameter objects, performs no I/O.
