"""Shared observability lifecycle for ingest pipelines.

The CLI layer (not the pipeline modules) owns the event lifecycle so the
pipelines stay pure and testable. Two helpers live here:

* :func:`pipeline_run` — wraps a *single-chunk* ingest (IBGE, BCB inflation, BCB
  currency, and future single-shot sources) in the exact event sequence one
  sweep emits, so every such command shares one code path and shows up
  identically in ``embrapa monitor``.

* :func:`chunked_run` — the per-chunk observability scaffold (``chunks_ok`` /
  ``chunks_failed`` bookkeeping, the ``chunk_start`` / ``chunk_end`` /
  ``chunk_error`` emit pair, per-chunk timing, and the ``pipeline_end``
  summary) factored out of the three multi-chunk commands (``ingest comex``,
  ``ingest comtrade``, ``ingest ibge-batch``). The command body stays thin: it
  drives a loop (or delegates the loop to ``pipeline.run(on_chunk=...)``) and
  reports each chunk through the yielded :class:`ChunkTracker`.

Two small value types are shared between the pipeline modules and the CLI so a
pipeline can describe a chunk's fate without importing typer/console:

* :class:`ChunkOutcome` — what happened to one chunk (loaded / skipped / failed).
* :class:`IngestPartialFailure` — raised by ``pipeline.run`` when it owns the
  loop (no live ``on_chunk`` consumer, e.g. ``ingest all``) and at least one
  chunk failed, so a source-level handler can collect it.

Single-chunk event sequence emitted by :func:`pipeline_run`:

    pipeline_start ─► chunk_start ─► [ your work runs here ]
                                        │
                          success ──────┤────► chunk_end + pipeline_end(ok=1)
                          exception ────┘────► chunk_error + pipeline_end(failed=1)  (re-raised)
