## [Unreleased]

_Nada ainda — `1.4.2` é o release atual._

---

## [1.4.2] — 2026-06-21

Audit remediation. A post-feature adversarial sweep (45 agents) found that making the
herd value-aware in 6 views still left the **same value-assumption bug class** in code
paths not touched by `1.4.0`/`1.4.1`: a herd basket (a value-less stock) silently
rendered R$ 0, empty maps, or wrong exports. Preview-verified on real production PPM data.

### Fixed
- **`dataFilters` cube path dropped `q_count`** — once a product-subset loaded the geo
  cube, the herd's geographic Gini/HHI/Lorenz collapsed to all-zero (the snapshot path
  kept it; the cube path didn't). `regionData` likewise now carries `q_count`.
- **Overview "Quantidade · Contagem" KPI blended incompatible quantities** — it summed
  ~68 bi eggs (a flow) + ~1.9 bi heads (a stock) across 8 non-additive species into one
  meaningless headline on PPM's default view. It is now **suppressed when the basket
  contains a stock**, with a note pointing to the per-species **Rebanho** view; the geo
  digest map + "UFs cobertas" counter read headcount for a value-less basket.
- **`ViewGeography` was herd-blind** — it now offers a **"Quantidade (cabeças)"**
  dimension (with a não-somar-entre-espécies caveat) instead of an all-zero Valor map;
  `value` is gated on having value so a herd defaults to cabeças.
- **`ViewValueVolume` showed R$ 0** for a herd — the monetary cards are gated on having
  value, with an honest note redirecting a herd basket to Rebanho.
- **CSV export** — added a `qtd_contagem_un` column to the aggregate/geo/concentration
  exports, and fixed the per-product export that **mislabelled a headcount as tonnes**
  (`fam==='volume'?…:t`) and scaled it 1000× wrong; now a family→unit map.
- **`ViewProductProfile` "Participação no efetivo"** denominator no longer blends the
  herd stock with egg/milk count-flows (a stock's share is among other stocks).
- **`serialize_products_by_uf`** now emits the `q_count` its SQL already computed (was a
  dead column), so 'Produtos do estado' can rank a herd by headcount.

### Changed / docs / tests
- `ViewProductCompare` titles the normalized chart "do efetivo (cabeças)" for an all-herd
  basket (was hardcoded "do valor"); `overviewTS` contract + `serialize_geo_yearly`
  docstring corrected; `frontend_data_contract.md` documents `measure_kind`/`q_count`;
  added the missing `.qa-facet` CSS.
- New lock-in tests: `serialize_product_uf` + `serialize_products_by_uf` q_count,
  ViewConcentration cabeças fallback, ViewOverview count-KPI suppression, `pearsonByYear`
  `key='q'`. **854 pytest / 228 vitest green; eslint + ruff clean; build OK.**
- **Baseline health stayed excellent** (96% backend coverage, sql.py 100%, max CC C(12)
  pre-existing, MI all A); security review confirmed **no new injection/SSRF/auth-bypass**.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-06-20

Refinement to the livestock herd feature (`1.4.0`), preview-verified end-to-end against
the local webapi on real production PPM data (composição Galináceos 82% / Bovino 12%, UF
líder PR; Perfil stock=Bovino mostra efetivo 238 mi cab sem Valor/Preço).

### Added
- **Stock/flow facet on the Qualidade view** — for a banco carrying `measure_kind`
  (livestock), the per-product data-quality breakdown splits into **Estoque** (the herd —
  value-less, so its flags are OK vs quantidade-ausente) and **Fluxo** (animal products —
  value + quantity). The two have structurally different flag profiles, so one merged list
  blurred the diagnosis.

### Changed
- **Overview count KPI relabelled** `Efetivo/contagem` → **`Quantidade · Contagem`** — the
  KPI sums the herd (a stock) AND eggs (a flow), so "Efetivo" overclaimed; the neutral
  label is consistent with the Massa/Volume quantity KPIs.
- **`vite.config.js`** — a `preview` proxy now mirrors the dev `/api` proxy, so a production
  build can be smoke-tested against the local webapi (`npm run preview`). Used to
  preview-verify this change: the experimental rolldown-vite **dev** server mishandles the
  injected JSX runtime ("require is not defined"), so the **build** preview is the reliable
  local-verification path.

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-20

Makes the **IBGE PPM herd visible**. The livestock headcount — ~⅔ of
`gold_ppm_production`, the largest single body of rows the new banco added — was
structurally invisible as a quantity (every chart showed `q: null` for it). This
release gives `contagem` its own quantity track end-to-end and adds a dedicated
**Rebanho** perspective; no Gold rebuild (the headcount was already in `qty_base`).

### Added
- **New perspective: "Rebanho"** (`frontend/src/ui/ViewRebanho.jsx`) — the herd
  (efetivo dos rebanhos) view, gated on a new `herd` capability that only IBGE PPM
  provides. Cabeças-only (no monetary axis): latest-year composition by species
  (donut), 50-year per-species evolution (multi-line — never stacked, since heads of
  different species are not additive) and a per-UF headcount tile map of the focused
  species, with honest "estoque, não somar entre espécies" caveats.
- **`q_count` quantity track (the keystone)** — `contagem` (livestock head + eggs) gets
  its own per-family `qty_base` column across the serving readers (`serving/sql.py`) and
  the serializer (`webapi/serializers.py`), so the herd now renders a real quantity where
  it previously emitted `q: null`. `serialize_product_uf` also carries `q_count`, so a
  value-less stock ranks UFs by headcount instead of an all-zero value.
- **`measure_kind` (stock|flow) on the products list** — exposed PPM-only via a gateway
  flag (`with_measure_kind`), letting the UI separate the value-less herd (stock) from
  the animal-product flows (eggs/milk) that share the `contagem` family.

### Changed
- **Analytical views are now value-less-aware** — each perspective implicitly treated
  monetary `value` as the universal measure, which a stock (the herd) breaks. **Perfil
  do produto** swaps Valor/Preço for Efetivo/Pico and ranks UFs by headcount for a stock;
  **Visão geral** adds an efetivo KPI; **Comparativo** indexes (base 100) and correlates
  a herd on headcount instead of a flat-zero value line; **Concentração** falls back to
  cabeças (Gini/HHI/Lorenz) for a value-less basket.
- **Count formatters + unit registry** — new `formatCountQty`/`countQtyMul`/
  `countAxisLabel` (mirroring mass/volume); `UNIT_FAMILIES` re-keyed `contagem`→`count`
  to match the token the serializer emits — a latent mismatch that was dormant until the
  first count-family product rendered a quantity.

### Tests
- New `ViewRebanho.test.jsx` (herd built from stock species only; cabeças-only
  composition/evolution; honest empty state) + a count-KPI lock-in in
  `ViewOverview.test.jsx`; serializer + `sql.products`/`product_timeseries` gain
  `q_count`/`measure_kind` coverage. **853 pytest / 223 vitest green; eslint + ruff
  clean; vite build OK.**

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-20

New dashboard banco **IBGE PPM** (livestock), now **LIVE in production**, plus a SIDRA
ingestion-robustness fix that unblocked its historical backfill.

### Added
- **New data source: IBGE PPM** (Pesquisa da Pecuária Municipal) — a new dashboard
  banco `ibge_ppm` for livestock: herd headcount (SIDRA 3939, Cabeças) + animal
  production (SIDRA 74 — leite/ovos/mel/lã, with value). PPM is **multi-table**
  (a first for the SIDRA sources): one `ingest ibge-ppm` ingests both tables into
  two Bronze tables, unioned in `silver_ibge_ppm` with a `measure_kind` (stock|flow)
  discriminator. New `gold_ppm_production` (no área/yield — livestock) + serving mart
  `serving_ppm_annual` ride the full deflation/FX matrix and the PEVS-shaped gateway
  readers with no new query SQL. Capability-wise PEVS-shaped (`provides` product/geo/
  quality, **no** produtividade). New `PPM_*` knobs + `BQ_BRONZE_PPM_{HERD,ANIMAL}_TABLE`;
  excluded from nightly `ingest all` (annual) — on-demand via `ingest ibge-ppm` + the
  monthly `schedule_ppm.sh` (cron `0 4 3 * *`). New unit_family_conversions seed rows
  fold the SIDRA ×1000 "Mil litros"/"Mil dúzias" scale. **Activated 2026-06-20**:
  Bronze backfilled 1974→2024 (2.27M herd + 3.41M animal rows) via the Cloud Run Job,
  Gold/serving built (2.4M-row `gold_ppm_production`, all dbt tests green on prod data),
  and the `banco_metadata` maturity set to `beta`.

### Changed
- **Volume-based dynamic SIDRA timeout + jittered exponential backoff** (#148) — the
  flat 75s per-request drain budget was too tight to stream a wide-window / many-product
  IBGE response when SIDRA is slow (it killed the PPM backfill: a cell-halved 13y ×
  8-product query for a big state couldn't drain in 75s, and a slow-byte timeout — unlike
  a cell-limit error — never triggered further halving). The drain + retry budgets now
  scale with the request's period×product×variable volume (above the lean floor, clamped
  to a ceiling), and `http_retry_policy` uses full-jitter exponential backoff to
  de-synchronise the parallel state-fetch workers. Shared by IBGE/BCB/COMEX.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-19

Capability-aware UI: the dashboard now surfaces **only what each data source can
actually do** — across the single-banco filter menu, the multi-fonte perspectives,
and the cross-source pickers — so the screen is never cluttered with options that
lead nowhere. Plus a leaner analytical bundle and a dead-code/doc sweep. No data or
mart-grain change — the new code runs against the existing prod Gold/serving tables.

### Added
- **Dynamic, capability-gated filter menu** (#143) — every filter option now loads
  from a per-banco schema (`FILTER_SCHEMAS`): a dimension appears only when the active
  banco provides it, instead of always-on filters that silently no-op. The **Fluxo**
  segment (exportação/importação) became a real **server-side** filter — it re-fetches
  the snapshot scoped to the chosen flow (the marts already carry `flow`; no dbt change).
- **Capability-gated multi-fonte perspectives** (#144) — the cross-source perspective
  picker now **disables** (with a "Demonstração" badge + reason) the perspectives whose
  source does not exist yet (`cross_chain`/`cross_lag` — they need SEFAZ inter-UF flows /
  monthly PEVS), via a new `crossViewApplies` gate (data-blocked / source-availability /
  ≥2 comparable series). The cross-source **series picker** hides banco cards with no
  comparable metric (PAM) and disables the chips of metric-but-no-data bancos (SEFAZ).
- **Family-gated commodity pickers** (#145) — the **Coeficiente de exportação** and
  **Preço: porteira vs. FOB** views (which compare PEVS mass to COMEX weight) now offer
  ONLY pure-mass commodities and open on a real indicator, instead of defaulting to the
  always-incompatible "Cesta completa". `/api/catalog` now carries each commodity's PEVS
  `family` (derived from the existing `_pevs_family_by_commodity` index).

### Changed
- **Leaner analytical bundle** (#141) — the audit-polish pass trimmed the Plotly
  payload, raised `webapi` test coverage, and documented `PYTHONUTF8=1` for local dbt
  on Windows (cp1252 crash fix).
- **Dead-code & doc-staleness sweep** (#142) — removed backend + frontend orphans,
  wired the dormant `contracts.js` runtime contract-lint, and fixed 5 stale docs;
  0 synthetic-data leftovers remain.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-19

Full remediation of the 2026-06-18 repository audit (#138) — **0 critical / 0 high**;
the focus was displayed-number correctness, plus security/robustness hardening and
test coverage. Verified live in production (dashboard reads + curation writes).

### Added
- **Security hardening** — `current_author()` fails CLOSED on Cloud Run without
  `IAP_AUDIENCE` (refuses to stamp a forgeable curation author); `deploy/webapi/deploy.sh`
  hard-fails post-deploy if `invoker-iam-disabled=true` or `iap-enabled≠true`; the
  `release.yml` `version` input is env-indirected + validated. New `embrapa doctor`
  **`currency-codes`** probe guards `BCB_CURRENCY_SERIES` against a stale-`.env` FX
  regression.
- **dbt numeric + grain tests** — a deflation/FX `unit_test` on `gold_pevs_production`
  (the scientific core, previously untested numerically; validated on BigQuery),
  uniqueness tests on the `silver_bcb_inflation`/`silver_bcb_currency` grain, and an
  `if: failure()` stale-marts alert on the nightly prod build.
- **Test coverage** — `serving/gateway.py` 80% → 99% (parametrized reader-wiring
  tests), frontend View render tests (ViewQuality/Overview/Concentration), and
  nested snapshot-contract drift detection.
- **Dependabot** now also covers the `pip` (Python) and `npm` (frontend) trees.

### Changed
- **ESLint now lints `frontend/src/ui/`** (the live production UI), fixing the
  previously-hidden dead code, stale `eslint-disable` directives, and hook deps.
- **Sidebar + modal accessibility** — sidebar items are keyboard/screen-reader
  operable (role/tabindex/Enter), and the filter + citation modals close on Escape
  with `aria-modal`.
- **`v1.1.0` deployed** — `IAP_AUDIENCE` is now set on the prod Cloud Run service, so
  curation uses the cryptographic IAP-JWT verification (no longer the spoofable
  plaintext header).

### Fixed
- **Quality-flag taxonomy** — the frontend registry now matches the real Gold flags
  (`OK/MISSING_VALUE/MISSING_QUANTITY/MISSING_WEIGHT/INCOMPLETE`). The stale prototype
  taxonomy was silently dropping `INCOMPLETE`/`MISSING_WEIGHT` from the Quality view +
  filter and leaking raw English ids in place of the pt-BR labels.
- **Physical-quantity scaling** — `product_timeseries` emits per-family base sums
  (`q_mass`/`q_vol`) so mass and volume are never blended and count/energy/area
  quantities are no longer mis-scaled (no more `count ÷ 1e6`).
- **COMTRADE partner ranking + flow Sankey** pin the reporter to Brazil, fixing the
  2022–2023 all-reporters multi-count.
- **COMEX freshness** — only the ETag confirms "current" (Last-Modified is too weak
  for a same-second republish); **COMTRADE** permanent truncations are logged
  distinctly (operator action required) instead of buried as a generic failure.
- **Docs** — a stale `src/proto` reference, 5 repo-escaping `../` links in
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`, the renamed curation SCD2 view/log-table names, the CONTRIBUTING
  CI-checks list, and the BCB delta-overlap granularity wording.

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Dedicated dashboard rebuilt as a React SPA + Flask REST `webapi`** (Plotly.js
  charts), replacing the Dash UI entirely — served from one origin behind Cloud Run
  direct IAP (`src/embrapa_commodities/webapi/`, `frontend/`). The Dash package was
  removed at cutover.
- **Decoupled release CI** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` (#132) builds a
  versioned, immutable `webapi` image to Artifact Registry on a `v*` tag; deploy
  without rebuild via `WEBAPI_SKIP_BUILD=1 WEBAPI_TAG=vX deploy/webapi/deploy.sh`.
  Pinned action SHAs bumped to Node-24 majors (#133). `v1.0.0` released + deployed.
- **Per-UF chart scoping + new chart metrics (P1–P6, #131)** — partner metric
  toggle (value|weight|price), OLS trendlines, value-added volume+price, and a
  dual-metric seasonality; `serving_comex_seasonality` grain now includes
  `state_acronym` (×UF).
- **UN Comtrade world/all-reporters full-history backfill runbook** —
  `docs/comtrade_world_backfill.md` (#128), with a daily Cloud Run Job scheduler.

### Changed
- **IAP-only ingress + scale-to-zero, no load balancer (#122).** The dashboard runs
  Cloud Run direct IAP (`ingress=all` + IAP, `min-instances=0`) — the zero-fixed-cost
  posture; an external HTTPS LB stays future-only / out of scope.
- **`silver_comtrade_flows` is now incremental** (`insert_overwrite` by
  `reference_year`, #127) — caps the cost of the all-reporters backfill.
- **`reconcile` is operator-triggered + a monthly reminder issue**
  (`.github/workflows/reconcile-reminder.yml`, #130) — no longer an unconditional
  scheduled run.
- **Enrichment is now a sidebar SECTION with one screen per tool** (was a single
  "Curadoria" item opening one window with internal tabs). The "Enriquecimento"
  section holds **Nível de industrialização** (`?ip=enrich_industrial`) and **Tipo
  de Mercado** (`?ip=enrich_market`), each its own screen over the same shared
  institutional store — so each enrichment can be done separately. `ViewCuration`
  split into `ViewEnrichmentIndustrialization` + `ViewEnrichmentMarketNature` with a
  shared apply bar; the old `?ip=curation` deep link still resolves (→ industrialization).
- **9-commodity scope across every source** — castanha-do-brasil, madeira, açaí,
  cupuaçu, banana, mandioca, soja, milho, arroz, each on the sources that carry it.
  Codes verified (live SIDRA, official NCM table, WCO/HS); COMEX gained a 4-digit SH
  *heading* tier in the product matcher.
- **Full historical backfill**: IBGE PAM back to **1974** (monetary reform absorbed
  via `historical_currency_factors`, was 1994+); UN COMTRADE Brazil-reporter to **1989**.
- **IBGE PAM and UN COMTRADE graduated `beta → estável`** (complete data, no caveat),
  flipped through the new editable `research_inputs.banco_metadata` override table
  (maturity/coverage edits are a BigQuery `MERGE`, merged over the registry by
  `/api/source-meta` — no rebuild/redeploy).
- **Geo filter nação restricted to Brasil** for domestic bancos: the cascade no
  longer offers foreign "export destinations" (China/EUA/…) — a prototype fabrication
  that mapped to no column in any geo-cascade banco (dead options). International
  partners stay a real dimension only for COMEX/COMTRADE, via their own país/partner
  filters.

### Fixed
- **The VALOR TOTAL hero ignored the state filter and the choropleth ignored the
  product basket** (Overview/Geografia). Both stemmed from the per-banco snapshot
  lacking a product × UF × year grain (the honest "a cesta não recorta a distribuição
  por UF" note). A new basket-scoped cube — `/api/geo-yearly`, reusing the existing
  `serving_*_annual` `*_by_uf_yearly` readers with `product_codes` (**no new dbt
  model**) — now lets the hero, choropleth, ranking and series respect **state +
  product + período together** (the note clears once the cube loads). `applyFilters`
  pulls it on demand and sums it over the selected states client-side; the value
  column matches the snapshot's via the active currency×correction.
- **Transparent retired→current code translation** — the dashboard now exposes only
  current codes, with retired-code history folded into them: `comtrade_hs_succession`
  + `comex_ncm_succession` seeds applied in the silver models (`coalesce(succ.current
  _code, code)`; raw kept in `*_code_reported`, the true natural key for the uniqueness
  tests). Verified: 0 retired codes leak to Gold.
- **Full codebase audit + live visual inspection: 117 confirmed defects resolved.**
  A two-phase audit (automated metrics + an adversarially-verified manual sweep)
  found **106 issues, all fixed** — including the three once-deferred items: the
  commodity-level curation dead-code removal, the UF/state filter wired into the
  trade flow/partner readers, and **real year-FX BRL/EUR for trade bancos**
  (retiring the frontend mock-FX rates; trade values now come from the Gold
  columns). A subsequent **live dashboard inspection** found and fixed **11 more
  UI/data issues**, most notably: the Overview/Geografia **per-UF map showed an
  all-years cumulative mislabeled as the latest year** (the per-UF readers now
  scope to the latest year, matching the national KPI and the `ano × UF` heatmap);
  a **misleading year-over-year on an incomplete latest year** (now anchored on
  the last complete year, with the partial year marked "(parcial)" on the series,
  composition donut and map — the backend exposes `monthsInLatestYear` /
  `latestYearComplete` / `latestCompleteYear` on `/source-meta`); **"UFs cobertas"
  counted COMEX pseudo-origin codes** (ND/EX/ZN…) against the 27 real states
  (ufData rows now carry a `real` flag); stale filter-summary chips; a duplicate
  `/source-meta` fetch; and the Saúde "saudáveis" denominators. Also corrected:
  the dbt 1994 `val_yearfx_*` CR$/R$ changeover, the append-only Comtrade
  `cpc_value` dedup, the quality-flag taxonomy (real Gold flags), the implicit
  price for volume-family products (1000× overstatement), and COMEX/COMTRADE mass
  quantities (kg summed and scaled as tonnes). Decomposed all radon grade-C
  functions and added ~210 tests (Python 497→701, frontend 47→103); full suite
  green. Detailed report: `docs/audits/codebase_audit_2026-06-12.md`.
- **Geografia choropleth ("Mapa" mode) rendered blank.** Confirmed in production
  (not a headless artifact): `brazilUfGeo` shipped **143 empty `[]` sub-polygons**
  inside its MultiPolygons (a shape-simplification artifact), and maplibre-gl 4.x's
  geojson-vt worker throws "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"
  on an empty sub-polygon, dropping the ENTIRE feature → 0 features → blank map. The
  GeoJSON is now sanitized once at load (`charts/geoSanitize.js`, unit-tested) into
  valid GeoJSON, and a `map.on('error')` handler surfaces any future maplibre error
  under our own prefix. The Geografia per-UF map/bars also gained the "(parcial)"
  marker on an incomplete latest year, matching the Overview.

### Removed
- **Chinese Yuan (CNY) dropped entirely.** The dashboard now offers only BRL, USD and EUR. Removed the external-FX path that sourced BRL/CNY (the `extfx_cny_brl` seed, `silver_extfx_currency`, and `scripts/refresh_cny_seed.py`) and dropped the `val_yearfx_cny` / `val_real_ipca_cny` / `val_real_igpm_cny` / `val_real_igpdi_cny` columns from every Gold fact (`gold_pevs_production`, `gold_pam_production`, `gold_comex_flows`, `gold_comtrade_flows`). Requires a `dbt build --full-refresh` to physically drop the columns; Looker Studio reports bound to the CNY metrics must unbind them (see `docs/looker_studio_setup.md`). China-the-country trade flows (COMEX/COMTRADE partner geography) are unaffected.

### Added
- **New data source: IBGE PAM (Produção Agrícola Municipal, SIDRA table 5457)** —
  annual crop production (área, quantidade, rendimento, valor) by municipality,
  the second IBGE/SIDRA source alongside PEVS. Lean first cut: 5 highest-value
  crops (soja, milho, café, cana, arroz) from 2010, surfacing **quantidade** and
  **valor da produção** in the dashboard (área/rendimento are carried in Gold for
  a follow-up). Reuses the generic SIDRA client; new `ibge/pam_pipeline.py`
  (two-phase Bronze, own `bronze_pam` dataset + `raw/ibge/pam/` segment),
  `ingest ibge-pam` CLI (**excluded from nightly `ingest all`** — annual,
  slow-changing — runnable on demand), `doctor` PAM probe + Bronze/serving
  targets. dbt: `silver_ibge_pam` → `gold_pam_production` → `serving_pam_annual`
  (column-identical to the PEVS mart, so PAM rides the source-parameterized
  gateway readers, the currency/correction toggles, and the quality views), plus
  a Silver→Gold conservation test. Banco `ibge_pam` graduates `planejado → beta`.
  Lean assumption: the monetary value is nominal R$ via ×1000 from "Mil Reais",
  valid for the post-1994 window (`PAM_START_YEAR` ≥ 1994). New knobs:
  `PAM_TABLE_ID`/`PAM_CLASSIFICATION_ID`/`PAM_PRODUCT_CODES`/`PAM_START_YEAR`/
  `PAM_END_YEAR`/`PAM_DELTA_OVERLAP_YEARS`, `BQ_BRONZE_PAM_{DATASET,TABLE}`.
- **IBGE PEVS is now delta by default** (like the BCB). `ingest ibge` / `ingest all`
  re-fetch only from `latest_bronze_year - IBGE_DELTA_OVERLAP_YEARS` (default 1)
  forward — absorbing PEVS revisions and a newly published year — instead of
  re-pulling 1986→today on every run (a huge request that blows SIDRA's slow-byte
  deadline on an unattended Cloud Run Job). `--full` forces the full window;
  `ingest ibge-batch` remains for the initial chunked historical backfill; a cold
  Bronze falls back to the full window. New helper `latest_reference_year`
  (`gcp/bigquery.py`) + `IBGE_DELTA_OVERLAP_YEARS` knob. Motivated by a Cloud Run
  Job smoke-run that failed on exactly this IBGE full-history fetch.
- **Architectural pivot — Pushdown Computing in the dashboard (replaces the
  in-memory/Pandas design, with its OOM/concurrency risk).** The dashboard (now the
  React SPA + Flask `webapi`) is **stateless**: UI filters turn into **parameterized SQL** (`@param`) on
  BigQuery, cached by **flask-caching**, instead of loading Gold tables into memory.
  - **dbt `serving/`**: marts pre-aggregated at the chart grains
    (`serving_pevs_annual`, `serving_comex_annual`, `serving_comex_seasonality`,
    `serving_comtrade_annual`, `serving_quality_by_source`) in the `serving` dataset
    (`BQ_SERVING_DATASET`), materialized as **tables** (cutting scan from GB→MB).
  - **dbt `core/`**: conformed dimensions `dim_date`, `dim_geo_br`; and the SCD
    Type 2 view `dim_code_industrialization_scd2` (gated by `--vars 'enable_curation: true'`).
  - **Dynamic curation (SCD2)**: append-only log
    `research_inputs.code_industrialization_log` (author captured from the IAP
    header `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email`); the UI does a live LEFT JOIN of the
    static mart to the classification dimension.
  - **Python BFF** (`src/embrapa_commodities/serving/`, optional `serving` extra):
    `sql` (@param + anti-injection allowlist), `gateway` (`@cache.memoize`), `cache`
    (flask-caching — `SimpleCache` scales multi-instance for free; `RedisCache`
    optional), `iap`, `curation` (append-only INSERT + cache invalidation).
  - **Multi-instance scaling without Redis (for free).** The dashboard scales to
    3–5+ Cloud Run instances without Memorystore: marts converge on
    `CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` (overnight data) and the curation classification read
    uses a **short TTL** (`CACHE_CLASSIFICATION_TIMEOUT`, default 30s) that bounds
    the staleness between instances (eventual consistency ≤30s) — the instance that
    edits invalidates immediately. `RedisCache` becomes **optional** (only for
    instant cross-instance consistency under high traffic).
  - **Automated ingestion**: `embrapa ingest all` packaged as a **Cloud Run
    Job** (`deploy/ingestion/`: Dockerfile, cloudbuild.yaml, deploy.sh, schedule.sh)
    + **Cloud Scheduler** overnight (off-peak). Shortcuts `make ingest-job-deploy` /
    `make ingest-job-schedule`.
  - **Reverts the previous "never pre-aggregate" stance**: Gold remains the
    comprehensive per-source table (ad-hoc aggregation at query time), but `serving/`
    materializes pre-aggregated marts for Pushdown — they derive from Gold, they do
    not replace it.
- **New source: UN Comtrade (global bilateral trade) — `gold_comtrade_flows`.**
  A global complement to COMEX (Brazil): worldwide `reporter→partner` flows for
  HS **0801** (nuts) + **chapter 44** (wood/charcoal), ingested at the
  **HS6** level (scope expanded to the 156 six-digit leaves), across the **four
  primary regimes** X/M/RX/RM, all reporters × all partners, annual grain.
  - **Ingestion** (`embrapa ingest comtrade [--full] [--from-raw]`): a *keyed*
    JSON API (`COMTRADE_API_KEY`, free), with the key **only** in the
    `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header (never in the URL/log). Two-phase raw zone,
    *chunked* by `(year, batch of 8 reporters)` and **resumable**. **Adaptive
    split** against truncation (`fetch_chunk_adaptive`): when a call hits the
    100k-row cap (a single dense reporter already overflows it), it recursively
    splits reporters→flows→cmd and concatenates. It stays **outside
    `embrapa ingest all`** (key/quota-gated).
  - **dbt**: `silver_comtrade_flows` (keeps only the fully aggregated record —
    `motCode=0`/`customsCode=C00`/`partner2Code=0`/`mosCode=0` — and HS6 only; drops
    the World partner `0`; normalizes `flowCode` X/M/RX/RM →
    `export`/`import`/`re-export`/`re-import`) and `gold_comtrade_flows` (the 4
    monetary conventions over `primaryValue` US$, **annual** deflation; bilateral
    reporter+partner geography via M49). Reuses `silver_currency` (USD/EUR/CNY) and
    `unit_family_conversions` (families).
  - **Seeds** of authoritative reference: `comtrade_country` (M49 → ISO3/name,
    `partnerAreas.json`), `comtrade_unit` (qtyUnitCode → family — 5=items, 8=kg,
    12=m³) and `comtrade_hs` (0801 + ch. 44, `HS.json`). Script
    `scripts/refresh_comtrade_country_seed.py`.
  - Initial historical window limited to **2022-2023** (config `COMTRADE_START_YEAR`/
    `COMTRADE_END_YEAR`) for development; extend later to older history.
- **Transport-modal dimension in COMEX (`via`).** `gold_comex_flows` gains
  `transport_route_code` (in the grain) + `via_name` via the new `comex_via` seed
  (MDIC CO_VIA codes → PT labels: Marítima, Aérea, Rodoviária…).
- **Cross-source product crosswalk** — seed `commodity_crosswalk` (links by
  *prefix*, at the commodity-concept level) + model `gold_commodity_crosswalk`
  (resolves to an exact `(source, code) → commodity`). Links the same commodity
  across PEVS (extractive code) / COMEX (NCM8) / COMTRADE (HS6) — the basis for the
  cross analyses (export coefficient, market share, trade mirror).
- **Data contract document** `docs/frontend_data_contract.md` — a Gold →
  frontend-snapshot map (field, magnitude, unit) for the BFF handoff.
- **Per-source provenance metadata** — view `gold_source_metadata` (one row per
  source: table, cadence, year coverage, counters `total_rows`/
  `products_total`/`ufs_total`, `last_refresh`), derived from the Gold tables. It
  feeds the frontend `dataStore.meta(id)` seam (provenance comes from the backend,
  not from literals); `implStatus`/`visible` stay as runtime config, documented in
  the contract.

### Changed
- **Quantities by physical unit family (schema break, no backward
  compatibility).** The fixed `[kg, t, m³, L]` format was removed. Every quantity
  row in Gold now exposes `family` (`massa`|`volume`|`energia`|
  `contagem`|`area`|`desconhecida`), `unit_native` (source label), `qty_native`
  (native value), `qty_base` (converted to the family's base unit) and
  `base_unit` (`t`/`m³`/`MWh`/`un`/`ha`). The conversion happens in **Silver**
  (Gold already delivers the final format). **`gold_pevs_production`** swaps
  `quantity_tons`/`quantity_m3` for these columns; **`gold_comex_flows`** swaps
  `stat_unit`/`stat_unit_symbol`/`statistical_quantity` for
  `unit_native`/`unit_native_symbol`/`qty_native`+`qty_base`+`family`+`base_unit`
  (statistical-unit resolution moved from Gold to Silver;
  `net_weight_kg` remains as a parallel mass-kg). **Rule:** never sum
  `qty_base` across families — every aggregation requires `GROUP BY family` (build
  `q_by_family = {massa:Σt, volume:Σm³, …}` at query time). Monetary value
  remains family-agnostic and summable.
  - New versioned seeds: **`unit_family_conversions`** (unit →
    family + `to_base`, single source — no factor hardcoded in queries) and
    **`product_unit_factors`** (a product→factor crosswalk for commodity units
    like saca/@/bushel/barril, which overrides the generic seed; no row → null
    `qty_base`, flagged for curation — never an invented conversion).
  - `data_quality_flag` reassigned to `(qty, val_brl)`. New curation (warn) test
    `assert_unconvertible_quantities_for_curation` and a
    **dbt unit test** with one case per family + a crosswalk override.
  - ⚠️ **Operational:** `silver_ibge_pevs` is incremental — run
    `dbt build --select silver_ibge_pevs+ --full-refresh` (dev **and** prod) when
    applying this change, otherwise the old partitions are left with the new
    columns null.

### Fixed
- **COMTRADE: resume now identifies the reporter batch by content, not by
  positional index.** The raw object was named `<ano>_r<índice>`, where the index
  came from slicing `list_reporters()` in the order of the UN reference JSON — if
  the UN reordered/changed the reporter set between runs, the same index would map
  to different reporters and resume silently skipped a batch whose composition had
  changed, leaving data never ingested. Now the reporters are **sorted** before
  batching and the basename is a **stable hash** of the batch's codes
  (`<ano>_r<hash>`), with `reporter_codes` recorded in the provenance.
  **Operation:** the first run after this change re-fetches the past years once
  (old basenames become orphaned; Silver dedupes).
- **COMEX/COMTRADE: the delta skip could leave a `(flow,year)`/batch
  permanently missing from Bronze.** When the raw was current, Phase 2 was skipped
  assuming "raw present ⇒ Bronze loaded" — false if a previous run archived the raw
  and aborted before the load. Now a `bronze_loaded_at` marker in the raw object's
  metadata (written after Phase 2; cleared automatically on a re-extract) is the
  source of truth: the skip happens only when the raw is current **and** has
  already been loaded.
- **BCB: the raw basename/provenance reflect the window actually archived.**
  In delta mode each series fetches only its recent overlap window, but the raw
  object was labeled with the configured `bcb_start_year` (e.g. "1980-2026") — a
  window the object does not contain. Now the label derives from the actual range
  of years in the data (`min`/`max` of `reference_date_str`).
- **`pyproject.toml`: license corrected from `MIT` to `Apache-2.0`** (the
  `LICENSE` file and all the other docs were already Apache 2.0); description
  updated to include COMEX/COMTRADE.
- **COMTRADE: ~2.5× double-counting in the Gold values/quantities.** The keyed API
  returns, per `(reporter, partner, cmd, flow)`, a **fully aggregated** record
  (`motCode=0`/`customsCode=C00`/`partner2Code=0`/`mosCode=0`) **plus** breakdown
  rows by transport mode / customs / 2nd partner — whose value **sums into the
  aggregate**. Silver kept everything and Gold summed it all together. Fixed by
  keeping only the aggregated record in `silver_comtrade_flows` (lossless: 546,812
  groups = 546,812 rows; Bronze untouched, no re-ingest). Total COMTRADE
  US$1,779bn → US$692bn; the COMEX↔COMTRADE mirror now matches.
- **COMTRADE: wrong physical unit families.** The `comtrade_unit` seed used a
  legacy qtyUnitCode table that does not match the API's codes. Validated against
  the HS6 `standardUnitAbbr`: **5=number of items (count)**, **8=kg
  (mass)**, **12=m³ (volume)** — previously ~24% of rows fell into the wrong family.
- **BCB FX series corrected (affected PEVS and COMEX).** The configured series
  were wrong: `3694` (USD) is **annual** — insufficient for COMEX's monthly
  deflation (it only filled Januaries); `4393` (EUR) returned ~127 and `20542`
  (CNY) ~4 million — **these are not BRL/unit quotes**. Swapped for PTAX **daily
  sell**: `1`=USD, `21619`=EUR (Gold averages by year/month). **CNY was removed** —
  the BCB does not publish BRL/CNY (nor USD/CNY) in the SGS or PTAX; a yuan column
  would require an external source (follow-up). This fixes
  `val_yearfx_{brl,usd,eur}` and `val_real_*_{brl,usd,eur}` in
  `gold_pevs_production` **and** `gold_comex_flows`.
- **`bcb/client`: SGS HTTP 404 treated as a window with no data**, not an error —
  series have different start dates (USD 1984, EUR 1999), so the `--full`
  year-chunking queries windows that predate some series. Previously, a `--full`
  from `BCB_START_YEAR` broke with a 404 on the first empty window.

### Added
- **COMEX reference dimensions — readable labels on `gold_comex_flows`.**
  Three seeds from the MDIC auxiliary tables (`bd/tabelas/`): `comex_unit`
  (`NCM_UNIDADE.csv` → statistical unit, e.g. `16`=METRO CUBICO, `10`=
  QUILOGRAMA LIQUIDO), `comex_country` (`PAIS.csv` → ISO-3 + PT name) and
  `comex_ncm` (`NCM.csv`, filtered for nuts `0801*` + ch. 44 → PT description).
  `gold_comex_flows` gains readable columns via `ref()`: `ncm_description`,
  `country_name`/`country_iso_a3`, `stat_unit`/`stat_unit_symbol` — 100%
  coverage of the current data. Clarifies the quantity semantics: `net_weight_kg`
  is always kg (comparable across products); `statistical_quantity` is in the NCM
  unit (m³ for most wood, kg for nuts) — do not sum across different units.

### Changed
- **Two-phase ingestion with a `raw/` zone — standardized across ALL sources.**
  Every source now follows **extract→raw→bronze**: Phase 1 archives the extract
  *verbatim* in GCS (`raw/<source>/<dataset>/<basename>.parquet`, with provenance
  metadata — URL, ETag/Last-Modified, `fetched_at`, `rows`); Phase 2 reads the
  raw back, filters/shapes it and loads Bronze. Re-filtering, changing
  products/rules or re-deriving Bronze **does not hit the source again** — only a
  real data revision triggers a re-fetch. New primitive `core/raw.py`
  (`land_raw`/`land_raw_file`/`read_raw`/`download_raw`/`list_raw`/`raw_provenance`)
  + `GCS_RAW_PREFIX`.
  - **COMEX:** Phase 1 downloads the full CSV→Parquet (all NCMs) and re-downloads
    **only when the ETag changed** (catching revisions to any year, not just the
    current one); Phase 2 filters the raw via `iter_batches`. `--from-raw`
    re-filters with no internet.
  - **IBGE:** Phase 1 archives the SIDRA response; Phase 2 loads Bronze.
  - **BCB:** each delta window becomes a raw object stamped per run (an
    append-only trail); `--from-raw` rebuilds Bronze by re-reading the trail.
  - Every `embrapa ingest <source>` gains `--from-raw`. The dead primitive
    `core/bronze.land_and_load` was removed (all sources use the new flow).
    Plan: `PLANS/raw_zone_architecture.md`. dbt/Silver/Gold unchanged.

### Added
- **COMEX source (MDIC Comex Stat) — complete Bronze→Silver→Gold pipeline.**
  A new *foreign trade* source (the first of the `flows` form —
  origin→destination), cross-referencing production × trade × FX × inflation of the
  same product. Scope: export **and** import, Brazil nut (NCM `08012100`/
  `08012200`) + the entire chapter 44 (wood/charcoal), at the month×NCM×country×UF
  grain.
  - **Bronze (`src/embrapa_commodities/comex/`):** `client.py` bulk-downloads the
    annual CSVs from Comex Stat (`EXP_<ano>.csv`/`IMP_<ano>.csv`; `;`/latin-1)
    — *stream to disk* (100+ MB files), pandas parse in chunks, column-precise
    filter on `CO_NCM`/`CO_NCM[:2]`. EXP (11 cols) and IMP (13 cols: +
    `VL_FRETE`/`VL_SEGURO`) unified into a schema-union (export writes NULL in the
    two). It does **NOT** use the JSON API (which returned the aggregated Brazil
    total under a malformed filter, HTTP 200). `pipeline.py` has its own `run()`
    with delta by `(flow, year)` (re-fetches the current year, skips years already
    in Bronze). The command `embrapa ingest comex` is multi-chunk (events per
    `(flow, year)` in the monitor); registered in `cli.INGESTS`,
    `doctor.SOURCE_CHECKS` (`_check_comex`) and `doctor.BRONZE_TARGETS`. Config
    `COMEX_*` in `config.py`/`.env.example`.
  - **TLS:** the host `balanca.economia.gov.br` omits the intermediate CA from the
    handshake (`requests`/certifi fails; curl passes via AIA). The public
    intermediate (Sectigo R36) is vendored in `comex/_ca.py` and appended to the
    certifi bundle at runtime — **without disabling verification**.
  - **Silver/Gold (dbt):** `silver_comex_flows` (dedup at the full source grain);
    `gold_comex_flows` (ONE comprehensive `flows` table, grain
    flow×month×NCM×country×UF, aggregation via `GROUP BY` in queries). Applies the
    4 monetary conventions over `VL_FOB` (US$): `val_yearfx_*` at the month FX and
    `val_real_{ipca,igpm,igpdi}_*` (US$→BRL at the month FX → BCB index → today).
  - Coverage: `tests/test_comex_client.py` + `tests/test_comex_pipeline.py`;
    schema tests in `_silver.yml`/`_gold.yml`. Plan in
    `PLANS/comex_flows.md`.
- **Shared Bronze landing primitive (D4).** The identical tail of the Bronze
  pipelines (`ensure_bucket` → Parquet upload → `load_dataframe` with
  partition/cluster keys) was extracted into a source-agnostic primitive,
  analogous to D1 (`core/http.py`): each `run()` keeps only what is specific to the
  source. `ensure_dataset` is left out because the BCB needs the dataset *before*
  the extract (delta lookup). **Note:** this step evolved, still within this
  cycle, into the two-phase ingestion with a `raw/` zone — the final primitive is
  `core/raw.py` (see "Changed" above), not an intermediate
  `core/bronze.land_and_load` (introduced and removed within this same cycle).
  Observable behavior preserved; coverage in `tests/test_core_raw.py`.
- **`core/http.py` — shared HTTP primitives (D1).** A new factory
  `http_retry_policy(transient_exc, deadline_s, max_attempts=5, before_sleep=None)`
  and helper `get_drained(url, *, total_deadline_s, transient_exc, context, ...)`
  encapsulate the tenacity retry policy and the manual body drain under a
  wall-clock deadline (slow-byte defense) that were previously duplicated in the
  IBGE and BCB clients. Shared constants: `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`, `DEFAULT_HEADERS`,
  `RETRYABLE_STATUS_CODES`. Observable behavior preserved byte for byte —
  source-specific deadlines (75s/180s in IBGE, 60s/120s in BCB) remain in the
  clients; unique defensive logic (IBGE period-halving, BCB year-chunking) also
  did not migrate. Coverage: 11 new tests in
  `tests/test_core_http.py` (including the slow-byte deadline test migrated from
  `test_ibge_client.py`) + 2 "delegate" tests asserting the kwargs passed to
  `get_drained` in each client.
- **Retry observability in the BCB client (D1.1).** `_fetch_window` now wires a
  `before_sleep=_emit_retry` hook into the tenacity policy, symmetric to IBGE —
  SGS series retries now emit a `retry` event
  (`series`, `window`, `attempt`, `reason`) that shows up in `embrapa monitor`.
  Unlike IBGE (which uses a contextvar because the UF lives one frame up), the
  `(code, window)` context comes directly from `retry_state.args`, since
  `_fetch_window` is itself the retried function. Coverage: a test of the hook's
  logic + a regression guard on the wiring (`before_sleep`).

### Changed
- **BCB inflation/currency pipelines collapsed into `bcb/series.py`.** The two
  pipelines were ~90% identical (`_extract`, `_effective_start_year`, `run`);
  they now share a generic SGS series pipeline parameterized by a
  `BcbSeriesSpec` (`kind`, `label_column`, `series_map`, `table`, `schema`, and the
  only genuinely source-specific line — `overlap_start_year(last) -> int`).
  `bcb/inflation.py` and `bcb/currency.py` became thin shims defining their spec
  and delegating. Public entry points (`inflation.run`/`currency.run`),
  constants (`DELTA_OVERLAP_MONTHS`, `BRONZE_SCHEMA`) and observable behavior
  preserved. **Deliberately reverts** the old note in
  `docs/adding_a_data_source.md` ("do not extract `_effective_start_year`"):
  on closer inspection, the difference was one line, today a `Callable` knob. The
  doc was updated to steer SGS series toward the spec, and differently-shaped
  sources toward writing their own `run()`. Tests consolidated: the duplication
  of the two test files became a single `tests/test_bcb_series.py` parameterized
  over the two specs + two thin per-variant files (the spec contract).
- **Gold renamed `gold_commodity_matrix` → `gold_pevs_production`**, adopting the
  `gold_<source>_<form>` convention (`production` for output measurement like PEVS;
  `flows` for origin→destination flow in future trade databases). Reinforces the
  rule of **one comprehensive Gold table per source** (ad-hoc aggregation at
  query time; pre-aggregated marts live in the `serving/` layer — see the
  Pushdown Computing item above).
  **External action required:** repoint the Looker Studio source to
  `gold.gold_pevs_production` and drop the orphaned `gold.gold_commodity_matrix`
  table in prod after the next `make dbt-build-prod` (see `docs/migration_history.md`).

### Fixed
<!-- Bug fixes -->

### Removed
- **Dash + Plotly UI layer removed (2026-05-29).** The frontend is being
  rebuilt with the Claude Design System in a separate flow. The following were
  deleted: the `src/embrapa_commodities/dashboard/` package, the
  `tests/test_dashboard_*` tests, the scripts `scripts/dashboard_*` /
  `scripts/check_dashboard_size.py` / `scripts/dashboard-*.ps1`, the
  `Dockerfile`, the workflow `.github/workflows/dashboard-smoke.yml`, the
  `docs/auth.md` and the Claude Code skills `run-dashboard`,
  `dash-page-scaffold`, `new-chart-component`, `deploy-cloud-run`. The `dashboard`
  and `visual` extras in `pyproject.toml`, the `check-dashboard-size` hook
  in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, the `--extra dashboard` in `ci.yml` and the
  `dashboard-*` / `test-smoke` targets in the `Makefile` were also removed.
  The backend (Medallion pipeline + dbt + `embrapa` CLI) remains 100%
  functional. The next handoff will join the new design system with
  this backend.
