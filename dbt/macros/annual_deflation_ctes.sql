{# Shared inflation-index + FX CTEs for the annual deflation pipeline.

   These four CTEs (inflation_year_end, inflation_latest, fx_year, fx_latest) were
   copy-pasted byte-for-byte into gold_pevs_production, gold_pam_production,
   gold_ppm_production and gold_comtrade_flows. Verified identical: the COMPILED SQL of
   this block is byte-for-byte equal across all four models (only comment wording
   differed). Centralised here so a change to the deflation convention — e.g. the 1994
   Plano Real FX changeover guard — lands in ONE place instead of four hand-maintained
   copies that could silently drift into inconsistent val_real_* / val_yearfx_* NUMBERS
   (DEDUP-1).

   Reads only silver_bcb_inflation + silver_currency. The downstream `enriched` real_*
   expressions that CONSUME these stay PER-MODEL — they genuinely differ (val_raw for the
   IBGE production marts vs primary_value_usd * brl_per_usd_avg for the COMTRADE flow
   mart), so they are intentionally NOT part of this macro.

   Emits the four CTE definitions WITHOUT a trailing comma; the caller adds the `,` before
   its own `enriched as (...)` CTE. #}
