-- Coherence guard for the physical-unit family columns across every Gold table.
--
-- `family` and `base_unit` are a pair: each family has exactly one base unit
-- (massa→t, volume→m³, energia→MWh, contagem→un, area→ha) and 'desconhecida'
-- carries no base. When Gold aggregates a grain that summed over multiple source
-- statistical units, picking `family` and `base_unit` with INDEPENDENT any_value()s
-- can pair them from different rows (e.g. family='desconhecida' with base_unit='t').
-- gold_comex_flows and gold_comtrade_flows therefore pick the unit fields together
-- from the dominant-quantity row; gold_pevs_production and gold_pam_production
-- lift them via independent max()s under a one-unit-per-product assumption.
-- This test pins the pairing invariant for ALL of them so a future edit (or a
-- broken single-unit assumption) can't reintroduce the mismatch.
--
-- Fails (returns rows) if any Gold row pairs a family with the wrong base_unit.
