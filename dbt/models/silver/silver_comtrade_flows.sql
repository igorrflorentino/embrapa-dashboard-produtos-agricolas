{#-
    UN Comtrade annual reporter→partner flows, cleaned, typed, deduplicated to the
    canonical bilateral grain — one row per (flow, year, reporter, partner, cmd).

    TOTALS-ONLY (2026-07): the base keeps ONLY the fully-aggregated record on every
    dimension, for HOMOGENEITY (every country reports the totals, even those that
    never break them down) and to be structurally free of double-counts.

    Filters vs the verbatim Bronze:
      • partner_code = '0' (World) is DROPPED — it is the reporter's
        pre-aggregated total over all partners and would double-count any
        SUM over partners. The total is recoverable at query time as
        GROUP BY reporter (the medallion principle: no pre-aggregated rows).
      • flow: ONLY the two direction TOTALS are kept and normalised — X→export,
        M→import. The sub-flows (RX re-export, RM re-import, DX/FM/MIP/…) are
        SUBSETS of X/M — neither ingested (config.comtrade_flows='X,M') nor kept —
        so X+M never double-counts a re-export against its parent export.
      • only HS6 rows are kept (length(cmdCode)=6): the ingest requests the
        6-digit leaves of the scope chapters, so any legacy HS4 aggregate row
        (0801/44) is excluded — keeping both would double-count in Gold.
      • KEEP ONLY THE FULLY-AGGREGATED RECORD (motCode=0, customsCode=C00,
        partner2Code=0, mosCode=0). The keyed API returns, per
        (reporter,partner,cmd,flow), one aggregate row PLUS optional breakdown rows
        by transport mode / customs procedure / second partner; the aggregate value
        equals the sum of its breakdowns. Keeping ONLY C00 (the "todos os regimes /
        total") is LOSSLESS for the total and collapses the grain to one row per
        (reporter,partner,cmd,flow,year). The ingest also requests customsCode=C00
        so the breakdowns are not even downloaded; this filter is the belt-and-
        suspenders guarantee for any historical Bronze that still holds them. The
        customs-procedure detail this discards is exactly what the FROZEN "tipo de
        mercado" feature needed — see that feature's memo. If a future analysis
        wants the mode/customs breakdowns, read the verbatim rows from Bronze.
      • reference_year is floored at var('comtrade_min_year', 2000): the base is
        anchored at the year-2000 boundary (config.comtrade_start_year), so a stale
        pre-2000 Bronze row the ingest no longer refreshes never reaches Silver.

    Quantity sentinels: chapter-44 rows routinely report qty = netWgt = '0.0'
    (quantity not collected). 0 is mapped to NULL so it reads as "no reading"
    (→ qty_base NULL, data_quality_flag MISSING_QUANTITY) rather than a real zero.

    Dedup is TWO-staged, because re-downloads replace whole chunks: ingestion
    lands one (year × reporter-batch) chunk per Bronze load, every row sharing
    ONE ingestion_timestamp (comtrade/pipeline.bronze_one stamps the frame once).
      1. latest_batch — keep only the rows of the most recent ingestion batch
         per (refYear, reporterCode). A re-published reporter-year thus REPLACES
         the previous generation: records the source retracted disappear here
         (row-level latest-wins alone would keep them forever). reporterCode —
         not the batch id — is the scope: a reporter-year is always fully
         contained in ONE chunk even if the reporter batching changes between
         runs. Residual limitation: a reporter-year republished EMPTY lands no
         new Bronze rows, so the previous generation keeps serving.
      2. deduplicated — row-level dedup on the natural key inside the surviving
         batch (the duplicate-qtyUnitCode collapse below).
    NOTE: this batch-scoped dedup shipped 2026-06 (audit fix). The model is
    incremental (below), so after any change to the dedup logic run ONE
    `dbt build --select silver_comtrade_flows --full-refresh` to purge phantom
    rows — a plain incremental build only reprocesses years with new Bronze.

    Materialized=incremental (insert_overwrite by reference_year), mirroring
    silver_ibge_pevs. The all-reporters historical backfill (COMTRADE_REPORTERS=
    all) makes Bronze tens of GB, so a daily FULL rebuild would scan all of it
    every run. Instead the build re-scans only the reference_year partitions that
    received new Bronze ingestions (affected_years, keyed on ingestion_timestamp)
    and insert_overwrites just those. The latest_batch dedup partitions by
    (refYear, reporterCode), so pulling the FULL affected year — every reporter —
    keeps the latest-batch-wins dedup exact. On --full-refresh / first build the
    is_incremental() branch is skipped and all of Bronze is scanned.
