-- serving_ppm_annual — pre-aggregated PPM (livestock) mart for Pushdown Computing.
--
-- Rolls gold_ppm_production (year × UF × CITY × product) up to
-- (year × UF × product × family), dropping the municipality grain. Column-shaped
-- like serving_pevs_annual (NO área/yield — PPM is livestock), plus measure_kind so
-- a herd STOCK (Cabeças) is never conflated with an animal-production FLOW.
--
-- Keeping `family` IN the grain is non-negotiable for PPM: its products span
-- contagem (herd/eggs), volume (milk) and massa (honey/wool), so qty_native/qty_base
-- are only ever summed WITHIN a family — never the forbidden cross-family sum.
--
-- Backs (frontend_data_contract.md §3): overviewTS (GROUP BY year), productTS
-- (GROUP BY year, product_code), ufData (GROUP BY state_acronym).
--
-- Grain: one row per (reference_year, state_acronym, product_code, family).
