-- serving_comex_annual — pre-aggregated COMEX mart (annual; month + transport
-- route collapsed).
--
-- gold_comex_flows is monthly and carries `transport_route_code` (via) in its
-- grain — a heavy multiplier the dashboard's annual/partner/UF views never need.
-- This mart sums over month and via down to
-- (year × flow × NCM × UF × country). Seasonality (which DOES need the month)
-- is served separately by serving_comex_seasonality.
--
-- Backs: overviewTS / productTS (annual rollup), ufData (by state_acronym),
-- partnerData & flowData (by country_code, flow), products (distinct ncm_code +
-- unit/family). Carries the same family/unit/qty AND currency set as
-- serving_pevs_annual so the BFF reads products/productTS uniformly across
-- sources. The monetary measures span {nominal, real IPCA/IGP-M/IGP-DI} ×
-- {BRL, USD, EUR} — the REAL year-FX / deflated values Gold computes (triangulated
-- through BRL, NULL pre-1994) — so a BRL/EUR display serves the real column instead
-- of cross-converting USD client-side. Raw US$ / kg / native-unit magnitudes — the
-- BFF scales to display units per the data contract.
--
-- Grain: one row per
-- (reference_year, flow, ncm_code, state_acronym, country_code, family).
