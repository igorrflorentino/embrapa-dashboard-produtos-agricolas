-- serving_comtrade_annual — pre-aggregated COMTRADE mart (global bilateral).
--
-- gold_comtrade_flows is already at (year × flow × reporter × partner × cmd), so
-- here the win is COLUMN pruning + clustering + crosswalk conformance rather than
-- row reduction: the dashboard reads a narrow, clustered table (the handful of
-- columns the partner/flow/market-share views use) instead of the wide Gold fact.
-- The `world_exp` denominator (brief §5) is derived by summing over reporters at
-- query time — the World partner is already dropped in Silver, so SUM is clean.
--
-- Carries the same family/unit/qty AND currency set as serving_pevs_annual so the
-- BFF reads products/productTS uniformly across sources. The monetary measures span
-- {nominal, real IPCA/IGP-M/IGP-DI} × {BRL, USD, EUR} — the REAL year-FX / deflated
-- values Gold computes (triangulated through BRL, NULL pre-1994) — so a BRL/EUR
-- display serves the real column instead of cross-converting USD client-side.
--
-- Grain: one row per
-- (reference_year, flow, cmd_code, reporter_code, partner_code, family).
