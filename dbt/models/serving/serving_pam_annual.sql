-- serving_pam_annual — pre-aggregated IBGE PAM mart for Pushdown Computing.
--
-- COLUMN-IDENTICAL to serving_pevs_annual (plus area_* extras) so the generic,
-- source-parameterized gateway readers (fetch_products / fetch_product_timeseries
-- / fetch_production_overview / fetch_production_by_uf) serve PAM with no
-- per-source SQL — PAM rides the entire PEVS-shaped snapshot and the
-- currency/correction toggles for free.
--
-- Rolls gold_pam_production (year × UF × CITY × product) up to
-- (year × UF × product × family), dropping the municipality grain. Area columns
-- are summed (additive across cities); yield is intentionally NOT carried (a
-- ratio is not summable — recompute as qty/area in the future área/rendimento
-- expansion). Grain: one row per (reference_year, state_acronym, product_code, family).
