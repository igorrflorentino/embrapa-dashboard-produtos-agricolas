# Operations Runbook

Occasional, get-it-right operational procedures for the prod deployment — the
things you don't do every day and that bite you on a fresh machine. Day-to-day
commands live in [`README.md`](../README.md) / [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md); this
is the "how do I safely do X against prod" reference.

## Managing attribute editors (who may save curation edits)

The curation write endpoints (`POST /api/attributes/*`) are gated by an
**authorization allowlist**, distinct from IAP authentication. The effective
allowlist is the **union** of:

- the `ATTRIBUTE_EDITORS_ALLOWED_EMAILS` env var (comma-separated), and
- the Console-managed BigQuery table `<dataset>.attribute_editors`
  (`<dataset>` = `BQ_RESEARCH_INPUTS_DATASET`, default `research_inputs`; table
  name = `BQ_ATTRIBUTE_EDITORS_TABLE`, default `attribute editors`).

If **both** are empty/absent, any IAP-authenticated caller may curate (open mode).

**Add/remove an attribute editor without a redeploy** — edit the table in the BigQuery
Console (or via SQL). No deploy, no code change:

```sql
-- add
INSERT INTO `<project>.research_inputs.attribute_editors` (email, added_by, added_at)
VALUES ('new.attribute editor@embrapa.br', 'you@embrapa.br', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());

-- remove
DELETE FROM `<project>.research_inputs.attribute_editors` WHERE email = 'old@embrapa.br';

-- list current
SELECT email FROM `<project>.research_inputs.attribute_editors` ORDER BY email;
```

Notes:
- Changes take effect within the classification cache TTL
  (`CACHE_CLASSIFICATION_TIMEOUT`, ~30s) — no instant invalidation needed.
- Emails are matched case-insensitively (lower + trim).
- The table auto-creates on the **first curation write attempt**: the curation
  POST authorization path (`routes._authorize_attribute_editor`) calls
  `serving.research_inputs.ensure_attribute_editors_table` (idempotent), so it exists for the
  Console INSERT above the first time anyone tries to save an edit. The runtime SA
  needs write access to the dataset to create it — the prod web SA
  `sa-web-dashboard-prod` already has WRITER on `research_inputs`. (If you prefer
  to create it up front, before any write, run the INSERT against the dataset and
  it self-heals, or call the helper directly.)
- Curation writes also accept an optional client `change_id` (idempotency key):
  a retried/double-clicked save reusing the same key is a no-op, not a duplicate
  audit row.

## Managing catalog editors (the "Cadastro de produtos agrícolas" admin view)

The **live Curadoria catalog** edits (the "Cadastro de produtos agrícolas" admin view → the catalog
write routes) are gated by a **per-catalog** allowlist, separate from the curation attribute editors
above: the Console-managed table `<dataset>.catalog_editors` (`<dataset>` =
`BQ_RESEARCH_INPUTS_DATASET`, default `research_inputs`; table = `BQ_CATALOG_EDITORS_TABLE`,
default `catalog_editors`), keyed by `(resource, email)` where `resource` is the catalog id
(`produto_catalog`). If **no** rows exist for a resource, any IAP-authenticated caller may
edit that catalog (open mode); add a row to lock it down.

```sql
-- add an editor for the produto catalog
INSERT INTO `<project>.research_inputs.catalog_editors` (resource, email, added_by, added_at)
VALUES ('produto_catalog', 'new.editor@embrapa.br', 'you@embrapa.br', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());

-- remove
DELETE FROM `<project>.research_inputs.catalog_editors`
WHERE resource = 'produto_catalog' AND email = 'old@embrapa.br';

-- list current
SELECT email FROM `<project>.research_inputs.catalog_editors`
WHERE resource = 'produto_catalog' ORDER BY email;
```

Like the attribute editors table: changes take effect within the ~30s classification cache TTL, emails are
matched case-insensitively, and the table **auto-creates on the first catalog write attempt**
(`routes._ensure_catalog_editors_table` → `serving.curation.ensure_catalog_editors_table`,
idempotent; the prod web SA `sa-web-dashboard-prod` already has WRITER on `research_inputs`).

## Curadoria orphan lifecycle: `mark-orphans` and `purge-orphan`

When a commodity is removed from the live Curadoria catalog, its already-ingested Gold
data does **not** vanish — it lingers as an *orphan*. The lifecycle that resolves this is
deliberately split: **detection + marking is automatic and NON-destructive; the actual
delete is human-gated and backup-first.** Both commands require the `webapi` extra
(`uv run --extra webapi embrapa …`) and append to the append-only
`research_inputs.catalog_lifecycle_log`.

### `mark-orphans` — auto-mark orphans Descontinuado (safe, idempotent)

```bash
uv run --extra webapi embrapa mark-orphans
```

Detects orphans (a catalog removal that left Gold data behind — not every uncataloged Gold
code) and appends a `descontinuado` lifecycle event carrying a deletion warning. It
**never deletes data**, is **idempotent** (re-running is a no-op), and its author is the
reserved SYSTEM identity `system:orphan-detector`. Run it on the ops cadence — e.g. right
after the daily `dbt build`, on the same boundary the catalog diff is computed.

### `purge-orphan` — human-gated, backup-first Gold delete

```bash
# 1. Print the scoped DELETE plan (backup-gated; nothing is deleted):
uv run --extra webapi embrapa purge-orphan --banco pevs --code 3405

# 2. After you have run the printed DELETEs yourself, record the terminal event:
uv run --extra webapi embrapa purge-orphan --banco pevs --code 3405 --mark-purged
```

`purge-orphan` **never deletes anything itself** — by default it only **prints** the
scoped `DELETE` statements for you to run manually (the repo's destructive-command hooks
block `bq rm` / `DROP` for automation anyway; see *Destructive-command safety hooks*
below). Two guards:

- **Backup-first hard gate.** Without a fresh Gold snapshot the DELETEs are **not even
  printed** — run `make dbt-build-prod-with-backup` first. `--force` overrides the gate
  and prints them anyway with a warning (NOT recommended: no restore point).
- **Descontinuado-only.** Only a code currently marked Descontinuado (by `mark-orphans`)
  can be purged; a re-added or never-marked code is refused.

`--mark-purged` appends the terminal `purged` audit event **after** you have run the
DELETEs (who/when — it does not delete data). It is idempotent per descontinuado
generation. `--author` stamps who purged; it defaults to the OS login user
(`operator:<user>`) so the audit row names a real operator — pass
`--author you@embrapa.br` to record a specific identity.

> **Permanence caveat.** Gold is rebuilt from Bronze by dbt, so the DELETEs alone are
> temporary. For a purge to survive the next build you must ALSO: (1) delete the matching
> Bronze rows; (2) rebuild the affected Silver models with `--full-refresh`
> (`silver_ibge_pevs` / `silver_comtrade_flows` are incremental and otherwise retain the
> rows); (3) drop the product from the ingestion scope (`config.py` or the catalog).
> Otherwise the data returns on the next `dbt build` while the lifecycle stays `purged` —
> a silent divergence. The command prints this reminder after the plan.

Spec: [`PLANS/curadoria_catalogo.md`](../PLANS/curadoria_catalogo.md).

## Q1 quality outlier/problemático detection (enable / revert)

`data_quality_flag` carries the 4 implied-price tiers (`OUTLIER_*` / `PROBLEMATIC_*`) only when the
dbt var `enable_quality_outliers` is `true` — it is **on in prod**. The setting lives in
`dbt/dbt_project.yml`, so the scheduled `dbt-build-prod` picks it up automatically; flipping it
requires a **Gold rebuild** (it rewrites `data_quality_flag` row-by-row). After a build, sanity-check
the per-source problemático rates (of all rows: PEVS ≈0.0009% / COMEX ≈0.0057% / PAM ≈0.020% / PPM
≈0.0003% / COMTRADE ≈0.15%). To **revert**: set `enable_quality_outliers: false` + rebuild → the gold
models compile byte-identical to the legacy 4-value flag (the flag is recomputed from Silver every
build — fully reversible, no data loss). Full method + spec:
[`PLANS/quality_outliers_and_visibility_gate.md`](../PLANS/quality_outliers_and_visibility_gate.md).

## Changing a banco's maturity / note / coverage without a redeploy

The dashboard's per-banco lifecycle metadata — **maturity stage** (`planejado` ·
`desenvolvimento` · `ingestao` · `beta` · `estavel` · `manutencao` · `descontinuado`), the
caveat **note**, the planned **date**, and the **coverage** labels — has its
defaults baked in `registries.py` (backend) and `bancos.js` (the SPA). Those are
the source of truth, but editing them needs a rebuild + Cloud Run redeploy.

For the common operational change (e.g. promoting a banco `beta → estavel` once
its backfill lands, or refreshing a coverage label), there is a **Console-managed
override table** — no rebuild, no redeploy:

- `<dataset>.banco_metadata` (`<dataset>` = `BQ_RESEARCH_INPUTS_DATASET`, default
  `research_inputs`; table name = `BQ_BANCO_METADATA_TABLE`, default
  `banco_metadata`). One **sparse** row per banco you have touched: each column is
  an override; a `NULL` column (or no row at all) falls back to the registry
  default. The API merges it into `/api/source-meta`, so the SPA's MaturityTag /
  MaturityBanner / coverage chips reflect the edit.

```sql
-- Promote UN COMTRADE beta → estavel (removes the caveat banner):
MERGE `<project>.research_inputs.banco_metadata` t
USING (SELECT 'un_comtrade' AS banco_id, 'estavel' AS maturity) s
ON t.banco_id = s.banco_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET maturity = s.maturity, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (banco_id, maturity, updated_at)
  VALUES (s.banco_id, s.maturity, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());

-- Update only the coverage label (leave maturity on the registry default):
MERGE `<project>.research_inputs.banco_metadata` t
USING (SELECT 'ibge_pam' AS banco_id, '1974 → presente' AS cobertura_years) s
ON t.banco_id = s.banco_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET cobertura_years = s.cobertura_years, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (banco_id, cobertura_years, updated_at)
  VALUES (s.banco_id, s.cobertura_years, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());

-- Revert a banco to its registry default (drop the override row):
DELETE FROM `<project>.research_inputs.banco_metadata` WHERE banco_id = 'un_comtrade';
```

Override columns: `maturity`, `maturity_note`, `maturity_date`, `cobertura_years`,
`cobertura_atualizacao`, `cobertura_granularidade`. Notes:
- Changes take effect within the classification cache TTL
  (`CACHE_CLASSIFICATION_TIMEOUT`, ~30s) — no redeploy, no invalidation needed.
- The table auto-creates on the **first `/api/source-meta` read**
  (`routes._ensure_banco_metadata_table`, idempotent). The prod web SA
  `sa-web-dashboard-prod` already has WRITER on `research_inputs`.
- `maturity` must be one of the seven stage ids above (`ingestao` = pipeline built but data
  still loading, order 3, no data yet; an unknown id falls back to
  `planejado` rendering in the SPA). Keep the registry the long-term source of
  truth: fold a lasting change back into `registries.py` + `bancos.js` at the next
  release so the default and the override agree.

## IAP author verification — set `IAP_AUDIENCE` in prod

Curation writes attribute every edit to a person (`edited_by`). That author can
come from two places, and **which one is active depends on `IAP_AUDIENCE`**:

- **`IAP_AUDIENCE` set** (production): the author is read from the **signed
  `X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion`**, cryptographically verified against this
  audience. A direct request to the backend cannot forge the audit author, and
  an ingress misconfiguration (e.g. an accidentally public service) fails
  closed.
- **`IAP_AUDIENCE` unset**: the in-app JWT double-check is **skipped**. With Cloud
  Run **direct IAP** enabled (the prod posture), the platform still authenticates
  every request and **overwrites** the `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email` header, so
  author capture stays trustworthy — the in-app check is defense-in-depth. The
  header is only spoofable when IAP is **not** in front (e.g. local dev), which is
  why this mode is paired with `DEV_AUTHOR` for local dev only.

> **Note (2026-06):** with **Curadoria frozen**, the live consumer of this verified
> identity is the **feedback channel** — `submitted_by` in `feedback_log` flows
> through the same `serving/iap.py` path, and the per-author feedback cooldown
> (SEC-2) only engages when `IAP_AUDIENCE` is set. So this stays a prod concern even
> though curation writes are dormant — keep it armed.

Operator steps (one-time per deployment):

1. Get the audience string: Console → Security → Identity-Aware Proxy → ⋮ on the
   **Cloud Run resource** → "Get JWT audience code" (the direct Cloud Run IAP form).
   *(Only in the future external-LB + IAP topology would it instead take the form
   `/projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/global/backendServices/<BACKEND_SERVICE_ID>`.)*
2. Set `IAP_AUDIENCE=<that string>` in **`deploy/webapi/.env.prod`** (copy
   `deploy/webapi/.env.prod.example`). That git-ignored file holds prod-only env
   that must NOT live in the dev/worktree repo-root `.env`; `deploy.sh` layers it on
   top of `.env` (prod values win), so a routine `make webapi-deploy` **keeps**
   `IAP_AUDIENCE` armed instead of dropping it — which previously forced an
   out-of-band / image-only deploy to restore. (`FEEDBACK_GITHUB_REPO` belongs here
   too.) Then run `make webapi-deploy`.
3. Verify: a curation save in prod records the IAP identity; with a wrong
   audience the write is rejected rather than silently mis-attributed.

Details: `src/embrapa_dashboard/serving/iap.py` and
[`docs/auth_architecture.md`](auth_architecture.md).

## Activating curation in prod (one-time) and keeping it built

> ⚠️ **FROZEN — Curadoria postponed to the "Versão Futura" roadmap phase (2026-06).**
> The curation/enrichment feature is partially built, not yet validated, and **hidden
> from the dashboard UI** (its topnav perspectives in `frontend/src/ui/views.js` and the
> "Engenharia de atributos" sidebar editor in `AppShell.jsx` are commented out behind
> FROZEN banners). The app runs fully decoupled from it. **Do not activate it in prod**
> until the feature is revived and validated — the steps below are kept for that future
> reactivation.

The SCD2 curation view (`dim_code_industrialization_scd2`) is gated by
`var('enable_curation', false)` so a fresh project builds green before the
curation log tables exist. Activating curation in prod is therefore two steps:

1. **One-time prod build with the var** (creates the view in the prod dataset;
   needs the curation log tables to exist first — `make ensure-curation`
   provisions them, though the per-code and flow-market logs also auto-create on
   first write):

   ```bash
   cd dbt && uv run dbt build --target prod --vars 'enable_curation: true'
   ```

2. **Flip the repo variable `DBT_ENABLE_CURATION` to `true`** (GitHub →
   Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables). The
   `dbt-build-prod` workflow adds `--vars 'enable_curation: true'` to every
   push-triggered, scheduled, and manual build when this variable is `true` —
   without the flip, merged changes to the SCD2 view (and its schema tests)
   are silently skipped by the automated builds and the prod view drifts from
   `main`.

Local prod builds after activation should also carry the var (e.g. the
`make reconcile` chained build runs plain `dbt build --target prod` — re-run
the command from step 1 afterwards if a curation-view change is pending).

## Triaging user feedback ("Reportar problema")

The dashboard's **Reportar problema** button writes each report (bug / dúvida / sugestão)
to the append-only `research_inputs.feedback_log` BigQuery table (auto-created on first
write), with the submitter captured from IAP and a permalink to the current view/filters
attached. Triage by querying the table:

```bash
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
  "SELECT submitted_at, category, submitted_by, message, url, issue_url
   FROM \`${GCP_PROJECT_ID}.research_inputs.feedback_log\`
   ORDER BY submitted_at DESC LIMIT 50"
```

Reply to the reporter directly — their e-mail is the `submitted_by` column.

**Closing the loop with GitHub (optional).** Each report is ALSO opened as a GitHub issue
(labelled `feedback` + category) when the service has `FEEDBACK_GITHUB_REPO` (`owner/name`)
**and** the `FEEDBACK_GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. The forward is best-effort — if GitHub is
unreachable the report is still durably in BigQuery (`issue_url` then null), never lost or
blocked.

Wire it up (one-time):

1. Create a **fine-grained** GitHub token scoped to **only** that repo with **Issues:
   Read and write** (not a broad classic PAT), then store it in Secret Manager:

   ```bash
   printf '%s' "<TOKEN>" | gcloud secrets create feedback-github-token \
     --data-file=- --project="$GCP_PROJECT_ID"
   gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding feedback-github-token \
     --member="serviceAccount:sa-web-dashboard-prod@${GCP_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
     --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor" --project="$GCP_PROJECT_ID"
   ```

2. Set `FEEDBACK_GITHUB_REPO` in the deploy `.env` (it is in the deploy allowlist). The token
   is mounted automatically: `deploy/webapi/deploy.sh` adds
   `--set-secrets FEEDBACK_GITHUB_TOKEN=feedback-github-token:latest` whenever the secret
   exists (override the name with `FEEDBACK_GITHUB_TOKEN_SECRET`), so a routine redeploy
   **keeps** the loop active — it is never a plaintext env var.

## Editing a dbt seed (currency factors, unit conversions) → run `--full-refresh`

**⚠ A seed edit does NOT propagate on a plain `dbt build`.** `silver_ibge_pevs` is
incremental (insert_overwrite by `reference_year`) and its incremental gate keys off NEW
Bronze `ingestion_timestamp`s only. A seed edit bumps none, so the corrected values never
reach the already-built partitions — most dangerously the **pre-1994 partitions** that
depend on `historical_currency_factors` for the currency-reform correction. The same holds
for `unit_family_conversions` and `product_unit_factors`.

After editing any of those seeds, rebuild the affected model(s) with a full refresh, e.g.:

```bash
# prod, via the GitHub Actions "dbt build prod" workflow with full_refresh=true, OR locally:
scripts/dbt-with-env.sh build --select silver_ibge_pevs+ --full-refresh --target prod
```

Do this at the release boundary and re-run `embrapa doctor` after. (The dbt guard tests —
`assert_currency_factor_no_overlap`, `assert_pre1994_real_per_unit_bounded`, … — are
post-hoc: they validate the built output, so they only re-fire once Silver is reprocessed.)

## Backing up prod Gold from a local / dev machine

`embrapa backup-gold` snapshots the Gold tables to
`gs://<bucket>/backups/run=<ts>/`. Two gotchas when running it **locally**
(outside the prod-targeted CI / Makefile path):

1. **It targets the DEV gold dataset by default** — a local `.env` resolves
   `BQ_GOLD_DATASET` to `dbt_dev_gold`, so a bare run snapshots dev, not prod.
   Override with `BQ_GOLD_DATASET=gold`.
2. **The impersonation SA can't write GCS** — the configured
   `GCP_IMPERSONATION_SA` (`sa-secret-reader-prod`) lacks object-write on the
   datalake bucket (403). Clear it so the client uses your own ADC.

Correct standalone local **prod** snapshot:

```bash
BQ_GOLD_DATASET=gold GCP_IMPERSONATION_SA= uv run embrapa backup-gold
```

The prod path `make dbt-build-prod-with-backup` sets the prod target itself, so
this override is only needed for a one-off local backup. `embrapa doctor` warns
when the latest snapshot is older than `BACKUP_STALENESS_DAYS` (default 14).

## Destructive-command safety hooks

[`scripts/claude-hooks/block-dangerous-commands.js`](../scripts/claude-hooks/block-dangerous-commands.js)
is a `PreToolUse` hook (registered in `.claude/settings.json`) that blocks
destructive command patterns before execution, at `SAFETY_LEVEL = 'high'`.
Relevant gated patterns:

- `bq rm` and `bq query … DROP {TABLE,DATASET,SCHEMA}` — BigQuery deletion
- `gcloud run services delete` — Cloud Run service deletion
- `gcloud storage rm … gs://…` / `gsutil rm` — GCS bucket/object deletion
- `gcloud projects delete`, force-push to `main`/`master`/`prod`, `rm -rf ~`,
  `dd` to a disk device, etc.

Implication: **deleting BigQuery datasets, Cloud Run services, or GCS objects is
blocked for assistants/automation in this repo and must be run manually** in your
own shell. Not gated: `gcloud run revisions delete` (only `services delete` is) —
and note it takes one revision per invocation, not a list. To lift the hook,
remove its entry from `.claude/settings.json` and restart the session.
